### :pushpin: 1.10 Test Design
Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases are:
Test design is a process that defines how testing has to be done. It involves the process of identifying the testing techniques, test scenarios, test cases, test data, and expected test results.
### :heavy_check_mark: Summary list of all tests performed.

Enter here what needs to be ready for the test execution to begin.

## :paperclip:	## 2 Test Execution
- Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary: [Cycle Summary](https://github.com/razvanandrei1974/Proiect-Jira-/blob/main/test%20summary%2006.12.2023.pdf)

### 2.1. Entry criteria defined
Smoke test passed (being the most basic type of test, this is a very important entry criteria in the process of testing) testing environment is up and running ### 2.2. Exit criteria:
83,87 % of tests are passed :white_check_mark:
Three Critical issues have Open status update tests are 84 % passed (update tests will  generate other new issues that impact the application).
### 2.3. Risks:
User data (banking related data, funds, transactions, etc) might be impacted with update tests stability risks (crashes, disconnects, etc), IE browser might have performance issues versions of IE older than 1.5923e have security vulnerabilities (we could mention what vulnerabilities are) the web page pagination could be impacted when opened on mobile devices stress conditions might impact the web application new browser might not be supported.

## 2.4. Test Analisys
###   :heavy_check_mark: He table below highlights the menus proposed for testing, both from the Manager category and from the Customer category.

## 2.4.1.Test implementation




## 3.0.  Test closure
- at least 83,87 % of tests are passed :white_check_mark:
  
## :pushpin: Conclusions:
* 62 test cases were created. :eight_spoked_asterisk:
+ 52 testcases received "Pass" :white_check_mark:
- 10 test cases were declared "Bug" of which RUT-60, RUT-69, RUT-72 and RUT-74 impact the product launch because the page crashes. :heavy_exclamation_mark:
* The RUT-55,RUT-61,RUT-63,RUT-64,RUT-65 and RUT-67 bugs can be fixed later. :heavy_exclamation_mark:
+ For testing, an Epic, 2 Stories and 14 Tasks were created.
- For the product launch, I recommend fixing all the bugs.
* After the fixing all the bugs execution of a "Regretion Testing".
+ Both from the Manager menu and from the Customer menu, all the tests specified in the Test Plan were executed.
- For future projects, I recommend that the menus and fields necessary to access them have a better functionality.

```

### üü¢ openaccount.features

```ruby
Feature: Open account

#  Background:
#  As a user
#  I want to open a new account
#  So that I can use the banking services
  @three
  Scenario: Successfully open a new account
    Given I am on the open account page
    When I fill in the account details
    And I submit the form
    Then I should see a confirmation message
```

## üíªTest setup

Test setup is implemented within the Given section. Even though these steps are executed imperatively to apply possible
side-effects, pytest-bdd is trying to benefit of the PyTest fixtures which is based on the dependency injection and
makes the setup more declarative style.

Many other BDD toolkits operate on a global context and put the side effects there. This makes it very difficult to
implement the steps, because the dependencies appear only as the side-effects during run-time and not declared in the
code. The "publish article" step has to trust that the article is already in the context, has to know the name of the
attribute it is stored there, the type etc.

In pytest-bdd you just declare an argument of the step function that it depends on and the PyTest will make sure to
provide it.

Still side effects can be applied in the imperative style by design of the BDD.

Example :

##  Create _Steps_ directory which includes the following files :

### üîÄ steps.login

``` ruby
import time

from behave import *


@given('I am on the login page')
def step_impl(context):
    context.LoginPage.navigate_to_login_page()


@when('I enter "{username}" in username field')
def step_impl(context, username):
    context.LoginPage.enter_username(username)
    time.sleep(3)


@when('I enter "{password}" in password field')
def step_impl(context, password):
    context.LoginPage.enter_password(password)


@then('I should see an error message')
def step_impl(context):
    actual_error_message = context.LoginPage.get_error_message()
    expected_error_message = 'The username and password could not be verified.'
    assert expected_error_message in actual_error_message


@when('I press the login button')
def steps_impl(context):
    context.LoginPage.click_login_button()

# @then('I should see an error for email')
# def step_impl(context):
#     actual_error_message = context.LoginPage.get_email_error()
#     expected_error_message = 'Wrong email'

### üîÄ steps.openaccount

``` ruby

```

## üíªHooks

pytest-bdd exposes several pytest hooks which might be helpful building useful reporting, visualization, etc. on top of
it:

* pytest_bdd_before_scenario(login, register, openaccount) - Called before scenario is executed

- pytest_bdd_after_scenario(login, register, openaccount) - Called after scenario is executed (even if one of steps has
  failed)

+ pytest_bdd_login_step(login, feature, step, step_func) - Called before step function is executed and it's arguments
  evaluated

* pytest_bdd_register_step(register, feature, step, step_func) - Called before step function is executed and it's
  arguments evaluated

- pytest_bdd_openaccount_step(openaccount, feature, step, step_func) - Called before step function is executed and it's
  arguments evaluated

## Reporting
