### :pushpin: 1.7 Test scope
#### Tests in scope:
Test scope is a documented description of the boundaries, objectives, deliverables, and criteria that guide the testing process. In essence, it defines the “what,” “why,” and “how” of your software testing endeavors.
![Test in Scope](https://github.com/razvanandrei1974/Proiect-Jira-/blob/main/TEST%20IN%20SCOPE.webp)

#### Tests not in scope:
1.1.5 Risks detected
Project risks:
### :no_entry: Critical Bugs - RUT-60, RUT-69, RUT-72 and RUT-74 impact the product launch because the page crashes.
### :arrow_up_small: Medium Bugs - The RUT-55,RUT-61,RUT-63,RUT-64,RUT-65 and RUT-67 bugs can be fixed later.

Product risks:
1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria
The entry criterias defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.
- Delays in the delivery of the AUT for testing
* Lack of technical knowledge on specific areas of the product
+ Lack of testing environments and/or data that effectively simulate real customer usage

### :pushpin: 1.8 Test Monitoring and Control
It will be done by generating periodic reports that reflect the current status of the test.
### Daily Report

### :pushpin: 1.10 Test Design
Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases are:
Test design is a process that defines how testing has to be done. It involves the process of identifying the testing techniques, test scenarios, test cases, test data, and expected test results.
### :heavy_check_mark: Summary list of all tests performed.
[Test Cases](https://github.com/razvanandrei1974/Proiect-Jira-/blob/main/Jira%20TEST%20CASES%20COMPLETE.pdf)

### 2.1. Entry criteria defined
Smoke test passed (being the most basic type of test, this is a very important entry criteria in the process of testing) testing environment is up and running ### 2.2. Exit criteria:
83,87 % of tests are passed :white_check_mark:
Three Critical issues have Open status update tests are 84 % passed (update tests will  generate other new issues that impact the application).
### 2.3. Risks:
User data (banking related data, funds, transactions, etc) might be impacted with update tests stability risks (crashes, disconnects, etc), IE browser might have performance issues versions of IE older than 1.5923e have security vulnerabilities (we could mention what vulnerabilities are) the web page pagination could be impacted when opened on mobile devices stress conditions might impact the web application new browser might not be supported.

## 2.4.1.Test implementation




## 3.0.  Test closure
- at least 83,87 % of tests are passed :white_check_mark:
  
## :pushpin: Conclusions:
* 62 test cases were created. :eight_spoked_asterisk:
+ 52 testcases received "Pass" :white_check_mark:
- 10 test cases were declared "Bug" of which RUT-60, RUT-69, RUT-72 and RUT-74 impact the product launch because the page crashes. :heavy_exclamation_mark:
* The RUT-55,RUT-61,RUT-63,RUT-64,RUT-65 and RUT-67 bugs can be fixed later. :heavy_exclamation_mark:
+ For testing, an Epic, 2 Stories and 14 Tasks were created.
- For the product launch, I recommend fixing all the bugs.
* After the fixing all the bugs execution of a "Regretion Testing".
+ Both from the Manager menu and from the Customer menu, all the tests specified in the Test Plan were executed.
- For future projects, I recommend that the menus and fields necessary to access them have a better functionality.

## 💻Scenario outlines

Scenarios can be parametrized to cover multiple cases. These are called Scenario Outlines in Gherkin, and the variable
templates are written using angular brackets.

Example :

## ▶️ Definition of test scenarios:

1. Create _Features_ directory which includes the following files :

### 🟢login.features

▶️ Functionality Menu Login with real and corect data.

```ruby
  Feature: Login Feature
  Background:
    Given I am on the login page
  @first
  Scenario: Login with wrong credentials

    When I enter "Razvan1199774499@" in username field
    And I enter "Bnc48757960$" in password field
    And I press the login button
    Then I should see an error message
```

### 🟢 login1.features

▶️ Functionality Menu Login with unreal data.

```ruby
  Feature: Login Feature
  Background:
    Given I am on the login page
  @first
  Scenario: Login with wrong credentials

    When I enter "user_name" in username field
    And I enter "password" in password field
    And I press the login button
    Then I should see an error message
```

### 🟢 register.features

 ```ruby
Feature: Register Feature

  Background:
    Given I am on the register page

  @second
  Scenario: Register with corect and real credentials.

    # When I press the logout button
    When I press the register button
    And I enter "Razvan" in FirstName field
    And I enter "Ungar" in LastName field
    And I enter "Ciocarliei" in Adress field
    And I enter "Resita" in City field
    And I enter "CarasSeverin" in State field
    And I enter "Z320038" in Zip Code field
    And I enter "P0726165557" in Phone field
    And I enter "SSN1740827354807" in SSN field
    And I enter "Razvan11997744" in User field
    And I enter "Bnc48757960" in Passw field
    And I enter "Bnc487579601" in Confirm field
    And I press the submit button
    Then I should see an error register message
```

### 🟢 openaccount.features

```ruby
Feature: Open account

#  Background:
#  As a user
#  I want to open a new account
#  So that I can use the banking services
  @three
  Scenario: Successfully open a new account
    Given I am on the open account page
    When I fill in the account details
    And I submit the form
    Then I should see a confirmation message
```

## 💻Test setup

Test setup is implemented within the Given section. Even though these steps are executed imperatively to apply possible
side-effects, pytest-bdd is trying to benefit of the PyTest fixtures which is based on the dependency injection and
makes the setup more declarative style.

Many other BDD toolkits operate on a global context and put the side effects there. This makes it very difficult to
implement the steps, because the dependencies appear only as the side-effects during run-time and not declared in the
code. The "publish article" step has to trust that the article is already in the context, has to know the name of the
attribute it is stored there, the type etc.

In pytest-bdd you just declare an argument of the step function that it depends on and the PyTest will make sure to
provide it.

Still side effects can be applied in the imperative style by design of the BDD.

Example :

##  Create _Steps_ directory which includes the following files :

### 🔀 steps.login

``` ruby
import time

from behave import *


@given('I am on the login page')
def step_impl(context):
    context.LoginPage.navigate_to_login_page()


@when('I enter "{username}" in username field')
def step_impl(context, username):
    context.LoginPage.enter_username(username)
    time.sleep(3)


@when('I enter "{password}" in password field')
def step_impl(context, password):
    context.LoginPage.enter_password(password)


@then('I should see an error message')
def step_impl(context):
    actual_error_message = context.LoginPage.get_error_message()
    expected_error_message = 'The username and password could not be verified.'
    assert expected_error_message in actual_error_message


@when('I press the login button')
def steps_impl(context):
    context.LoginPage.click_login_button()

# @then('I should see an error for email')
# def step_impl(context):
#     actual_error_message = context.LoginPage.get_email_error()
#     expected_error_message = 'Wrong email'

```

## 💻Hooks

pytest-bdd exposes several pytest hooks which might be helpful building useful reporting, visualization, etc. on top of
it:

* pytest_bdd_before_scenario(login, register, openaccount) - Called before scenario is executed

- pytest_bdd_after_scenario(login, register, openaccount) - Called after scenario is executed (even if one of steps has
  failed)

+ pytest_bdd_login_step(login, feature, step, step_func) - Called before step function is executed and it's arguments
  evaluated

* pytest_bdd_register_step(register, feature, step, step_func) - Called before step function is executed and it's
  arguments evaluated

- pytest_bdd_openaccount_step(openaccount, feature, step, step_func) - Called before step function is executed and it's
  arguments evaluated
